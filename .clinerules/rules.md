# Project Rules for Cline

## Code Style
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Prefer const over let, never use var
- Use meaningful variable names (no single letters except in loops)

## Component creation
- Do not create README.MD component files, create the minimal component files
- Create pixel perfect from Figma Designs
- Add shared components in the src/components folder
- For each component reated add a demo in the .component-section div at the Home.tsx page
