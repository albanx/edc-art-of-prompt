## 🛡️ Security Strengths

Your application demonstrates **excellent security practices**:

1. **Zero Vulnerabilities**: No critical security issues in code
2. **Modern Stack**: Latest React and Next.js versions
3. **Clean Architecture**: Static site reduces attack surface
4. **Secret Safety**: No exposed credentials or API keys
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

**Current Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

- **Main Risk**: Missing security headers allow browser-based attacks
- **Impact**: Limited due to static site architecture
- **Mitigation**: Easily fixed with configuration changes

## 🏆 Industry Comparison

| Metric | Your App | Industry Avg | Best Practice |
|--------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Critical Vulnerabilities | 0 | 2-5 | 0 |
